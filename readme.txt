Widget and shortcode to display all relevant site content numbers

== Description ==

= Widget =

The widget will show (and automatically update) the following site-content counters:

* Categories count
* Posts count

* Authors count

In the admin backend, user can select what counter(s) to display.

= Shortcode =

Add this shortcode in your page/post:

<pre><code>
[DSN-list]
</code></pre>
to show all the 6 counters. If you want to specify what counter(s) to show, use this syntax;

<pre><code>
[DSN-list show="Categories, Comments, Posts]
</code></pre>

Valid terms in the list are: Categories, Comments, Posts, Pages, Authors, Images, Tags.
